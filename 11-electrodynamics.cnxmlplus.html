        <h1>Electrodynamics</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In Grade 11 you learnt how a magnetic field is generated around a current carrying conductor. You also learnt how a current is generated in a conductor that moves in a magnetic field. This chapter describes how conductors moving in a magnetic field are applied in the real-world.</p>
<p data-class="video" id="scVPpjl"><a href="TODO">Video: VPpjl</a></p><h2>Electrical machines - generators and motors</h2>

<p>We have seen that when a conductor is moved in a magnetic field or when a magnet is moved near a conductor, a current flows in the conductor. The amount of current depends on the speed at which the conductor experiences a changing magnetic field, the number of turns of the conductor and the position of the plane of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field. The effect of the orientation of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field is illustrated in <a href="#fig:conductor" data-class="InternalLink">fig:conductor</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="caption"><p>Series of figures showing that the magnetic flux through a conductor is dependent on the angle that the plane of the conductor makes with the magnetic field. The greatest flux passes through the conductor when the plane of the conductor is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines as in (a).

which is the product of the magnetic field and the cross-sectional
area the field lines pass through.
As the closed loop conductor changes orientation with respect to the magnetic field, the amount of magnetic flux through the area of the loop changes, and an emf is induced in the conducting loop.</p>

<figcaption class="caption"><p>Layout of an alternating current generator.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><p>If a machine is constructed to rotate a magnetic field around a set of stationary wire coils with the turning of a shaft, AC voltage will be produced across the wire coils as that shaft is rotated, in accordance with Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic operating principle of an AC generator.</p>

<p>In an AC generator the two ends of the coil are each attached to a slip ring that makes contact with brushes as the coil turns. The direction of the current changes with every half turn of the coil. As one side of the loop moves to the other pole of the magnetic field, the current in the loop changes direction. The two slip rings of the AC generator allow the coil to turn without breaking the connections to the load circuit. This type of current which changes direction is known as alternating current.</p>
<div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>AC generators are also known as alternators. They are found in motor cars to charge the car battery.</p>
</div><h3>DC generator</h3>

<p>A simple DC generator is constructed the same way as an AC generator except that there is one slip ring which is split into two pieces, called a commutator, so the current in the external circuit does not change direction. The layout of a DC generator is shown in <a href="#fig:DCgen" data-class="InternalLink">fig:DCgen</a>. The split-ring commutator accommodates for the change in direction of the current in the loop, thus creating direct current (DC) current going through the brushes and out to the circuit.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><h3>AC versus DC generators</h3>

<p>The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with a moving coil are sparking and heat, especially if the generator is turning at high speed. If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapours, the practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater.</p>

<p>If the magnetic field, rather than the coil/conductor is rotated, then brushes are not needed in an AC generator (alternator), so an alternator will not have the same problems as DC generators.
The same benefits of AC over DC for generator design also apply to electric motors.
While DC motors need brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire, AC motors do not. In fact, AC and DC motor designs are very similar to their generator counterparts.
The AC motor is depends on the reversing magnetic field produced by alternating current through its stationary coils of wire to make the magnet rotate. The DC motor depends on the brush contacts making and breaking
connections to reverse current through the rotating coil every 1/2 rotation (180 degrees).</p>
<h3>Electric motors</h3>

<p>The basic principles of operation for a motor are the same as that of a generator, except that a motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy (motion).</p>
