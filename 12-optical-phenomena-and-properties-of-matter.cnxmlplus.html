<h2>Introduction  </h2>

<p>Many people are using solar power as a source of energy for their homes. Solar power can be used to heat water or to supply electricity. Have you ever noticed solar panels on homes and buildings? Have you  ever wondered how solar energy is converted to electrical energy? In this chapter, we examine the process that is used to achieve this energy conversion.</p>

<p>Around the turn of the twentieth century, it was observed by a number of physicists 
    (including Hertz, Thomson and Von Lenard) that when light was shone onto a metal plate, 
    electrons were emitted by the metal. This is called the photoelectric effect. 
    (<em>photo</em> for light, 
    <em>electric</em>  for the electron.)</p>

<p>The characteristics of the photoelectric effect were a surprise and a very important
    development in modern physics. To understand why it was a surprise we need to look at the 
    history to understand what physicists were expecting to happen and then understand
    the implications for physics going forward.</p>
<h3>History and expectations as to the photoelectric effect</h3>

<p>In 1887, Heinrich Hertz (a German physicist) noticed that ultraviolet light incident 
on a metal plate could cause sparks. Metals were known to be good conductors of electricity, 
because the electrons are more able to move. They should be able to
be dislodged if energy were added through the incident light. The problem was that
different metals requred different minimum frequencies of light.</p>

<p>The expectation at the time was that electrons would be emitted for any 
frequency of light, after a delay (for low intensities) during which the 
electrons absorbed sufficient energy to escape from the metal surface. The 
higher the intensity the shorter the delay was be as they would absorb energy faster. This
was based on the idea that light was a wave continuously delivering energy to the 
electrons.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that higher frequency light corresponds to higher 
energy.</p>

<p>The next piece of the puzzle came from Philipp Lenard (a Hungarian physicist) in 1902 when he discovered 
that the maximum velocity with which electrons are ejected by ultraviolet 
light is entirely independent of the intensity of light.</p>

<p>His expectation was that at high intensities the electrons would absorb more energy and so would have a greater velocity.</p>

<p>A <strong>paradox</strong> existed as the expectations and the observations did not match.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein (a German physicist) solved this paradox by proposing 
that light is made up of packets 
of energy called <em>quanta</em> (now called photons) 
which interacted with the electrons in the metal like particles instead of waves. 
Each incident photon would transfer all its energy to one electron in the metal.</p>

<p>The photoelectric effect is the process whereby an electron 
            is emitted by a substance when light shines on it.</p>

          </dd></dl><p>Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize for his contribution to understanding the
photoelectric effect. His explanation wasn't very popular and took a while to be accepted, 
in fact, some scientists at the time felt that is was a big mistake.</p>

<p>In the motivation letter for Einstein to be accepted into the Prussian Academy of Science
it was specifically mentioned as a mistake:</p>
