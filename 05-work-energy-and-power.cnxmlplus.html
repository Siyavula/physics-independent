        <h1>Work, energy and power</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We use the idea of work every day.  We talk about going to work, doing homework, working in class. What do we mean and are we correct?</p>

<p>In Physics we mean something very specific when we use the term work! Work is done when an applied force causes an object to move through a displacement.</p>

<p>Going to work involves a body &#8211; you &#8211; moving to a specific place i.e. the workplace and so work is done on the body moving.  While when you are sitting in your chair &#8211; you are not moving and so no work is done.  Be careful to not confuse what we say is work and what Physics says is work!</p>

<p>You will learn that work and energy are closely related. You shall see that the energy of an object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring energy from one object or form to another. In other
words,</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
            
<p>an object with lots of energy can do lots of work.</p>

          </li>
<li>
            
<p>when work is done, energy is lost by the object doing work and gained by the object on which the work is done.</p>

          </li>
</ul><p>Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them. Even making an electrical current flow requires that something do work. Something must have energy and transfer it through doing work to make things happen.</p>

<p>When a force exerted on an object causes it to move, work is done on the object (except if the force and displacement are at right angles to each other).</p>

          </dd></dl><p>This means that in order for work to be done, an object must have its position changed by an amount</p>
